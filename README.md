# 🛡️ SafeLink Analyzer

## 📋 Overview

SafeLink Analyzer is a lightweight, high-performance phishing detection system built using XGBoost. It analyzes structural and lexical features of URLs to accurately classify potential threats. Designed for cybersecurity applications, the tool supports both API and CLI interfaces, making it ideal for integration into security workflows, personal URL auditing, and enterprise-grade protection pipelines.

## ✨ Features

- **Fast Phishing Detection** — Leverages XGBoost for real-time URL classification  
- **High Precision & Recall** — Tuned to minimize false positives while maximizing threat detection  
- **Explainable Results** — Optional SHAP visualizations to interpret model decisions  
- **Modular CLI & API Access** — Scan URLs using command line or RESTful API for seamless integration  
- **Extensible Feature Engineering** — Customize input features based on domain-specific indicators

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Feature Extraction** — Converts raw URLs into structured vectors with lexical and heuristic features  
- **XGBoost Model** — Trained for binary classification of phishing vs benign URLs  
- **Prediction Pipeline** — Returns classification label and probability score for individual or batch inputs  
- **Flask API** — Serves predictions over HTTP POST for real-time scanning  
- **Visualization Module (Optional)** — Explains decisions using SHAP plots and feature importance graphs

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- `XGBoost` — Machine learning engine for binary URL classification  
- `Scikit-learn` — Tools for preprocessing, evaluation, and data splitting  
- `Pandas` — Dataframe manipulation for feature generation and batch processing  
- `Flask` — REST API for live prediction serving  
- `SHAP`, `Matplotlib` — Interpretability and visualization of model outputs

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- 4GB+ RAM recommended

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/safelink-analyzer.git
cd safelink-analyzer
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📱 Usage

### Single URL Classification

```bash
python classify_url.py --url "http://login.phishing-example.com"
```

### Batch URL Classification

```bash
python classify_batch.py --input data/urls.csv --output results.csv
```

### Run as REST API

```bash
python app.py
```

Send a POST request to:

```
http://localhost:5000/predict
```

With payload:

```json
{ "url": "http://suspicious-site.biz/login" }
```

## 🛠️ Customization

- Modify or extend features in `features.py`  
- Retrain model using:

```bash
python train_model.py --data data/new_dataset.csv
```

- Adjust hyperparameters via `config/model_params.json`  
- Add new visualizations using `explain_model.py`
